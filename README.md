# Best-streaming-service-analysis

Introduction:
Streaming refers to any media content which is live or recorded and is delivered to computers/mobile devices via the Internet in real time. Common Examples: Podcasts, movies, TV shows, music videos & generated webcasts.

Over the top (OTT) refers to any type of streaming media content delivered over the internet. It includes subscription-based streaming services where consumers can access content on-demand without having to go through a traditional satellite or cable provider. OTT platforms have come up with better content to attract even more eyes and hook viewers to the platform.

People are becoming used to catching the latest flicks on Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, and other emerging OTT platforms.

Objective:
1.Compare popular streaming services based on a set of key criteria.
2.Identify which service provides the best overall value.
3.Highlights strengths and weaknesses of each service.

The Analysis includes these steps follows as
Step 1: Select a real-world dataset
Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning
  Data preparation & cleaning is the stage where raw data is cleaned and transformed before performing any analysis on it. This helps us to identify the incorrect,   inaccurate, incomplete or missing values in the dataset. It is important step in Data Analytics because it ensures that we get accurate data and leads us to        better insights.
  Data cleaning involves basic steps like:
  1.Removing Duplicates or irrelevant values.
  2.Removing outliers
  3.Handling Missing Values
  For cleaning the dataset, We need to either modify, replace or delete the outliers according to our needs.
Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
  Performed EDA on below columns.
  1.Country
  Observation:
    From the graph,we can infer that United States is the ranked first based on the OTT content it produces as compared to other countries. United Kingdom produces     17% less and India & Canada produces 11% less OTT content in comparison to United States.
  2.Age
  Observation:
    From the Age Analysis, we see that OTT platforms favours mostly 18+ content. Number of Movies on OTT platforms increase with the increase in Age_group.             There's a very unexpected dip when it comes to 16-17 category. This could be because we have 9390 values for "Age" Column unavailable.
  3.Directors
  4.Year
  Observation:
    1.From the first graph, we can conclude that Movies on OTT platforms started to rise after mid 1950's.
    2.It increased more in a last decade. After taking a closer look at 2010 to 2020 interval, we can infer that from 2010 OTT streaming services become more           popluar. 2017 is the year where highest number of OTT movies were released with an unexpected decrease in year 2019.
    3.Release Year for Oldest movie: 1902 & Latest movie 2020:
  5.Runtime
  Observations:
    1.Majority of the movies have average runtime between 80-100 minutes.
    2.Few movies have larger runtime and most of the values are clustered around the left part of the distribution, hence we can conclude that it is positively         skewed distribution.
Step 4: Conclusion
Analysis Result:
1.From 1900 to 2020, OTT platform Prime Video has the highest number of movies (12345) streaming and Disney+ being the platform which streams less movies.
2.We can see that difference in number of movies available between Netflix and Prime Video is quite large similar to the difference between Hulu and Netflix.
3.We can infer from the above plot that no platform streams all movies and there are subset of movies which are available on more than one platfrom.
4.To end with, users should/must prefer Prime video over other platforms because it give you broader range of options.
